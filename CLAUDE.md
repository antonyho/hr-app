# HR Application Implementation Guide

## Project Overview

Build a single page HR application that provides employee profile page management and absence request.

## Application Description
A single-page application, including backend logic, to support the following use case:
Employee Profile (HR Application):
- As a manager or the employee who owns the profile:
    - I can see all data
    - I can change all data
- As a co-worker:
    - I can see non-sensitive data
    - I can leave feedback (which is optionally polished using an AI service â€“ use any free HuggingFace model)
- As an employee:
    - I can request an absence

## General Working Guidelines
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to `tasks/todo.md`.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. On every step of progress, give me a high level explanation of what changes you have made.
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Remember to keep the `CLAUDE.md` up-to-date on each progression.
8. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

## Architecture Summary

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: SpringBoot
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS + Next.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Container**: Docker + Docker Compose

### Architecture
- Single page frontend application
- SpringBoot as backend application container
- PostgreSQL database to store data (user role, user account, employee profile)

#### Backend services
- Authentication service: authorising access to different user roles
- Profile service: accessing and maintaining employee profile

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Project structure setup
2. Database schema and migrations

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. Authentication service implemenatation
2. Profile service implementation
3. Absence request service implementation
4. Basic Web Frontend

## Code Quality Requirements (Priority Order)

1. **Good Practices**: Follow best practices
2. **Test Coverage**: implemented features must have unit tests
3. **Error Handling**: Always check errors, wrap with context
4. **Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate levels
5. **Documentation**: README file for deployment and launch
6. **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention
7. **Performance**: Connection pooling, efficient queries

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Start with Shared Packages

Create common models.

### 2. Database Schema

Create database schema.

### 3. Docker Setup

Each service should have:
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for minimal images
- Health check endpoints
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Environment-based configuration

### 4. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests with test containers

## Task Planning Template

When creating `tasks/todo.md`, use this template:

```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]

## Objective
Brief description of what needs to be accomplished.

## Todo Items
- [ ] Task 1: Description
- [ ] Task 2: Description
- [ ] Task 3: Description

## Implementation Notes
Any relevant notes or considerations.

## Review
Summary of changes made and any relevant information.
```

## Memories
- Keep the CLAUDE.md up-to-date on each progression.
